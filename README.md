On top of AgroFIMS features, AgroFIMS+ allows the collaborative creation and management of agronomic survey questionnaires.

It incorporates features for defining and using question groups as templates, thus facilitating and speeding up the questionnaire creation process.

The AgroFIMS+ workflow facilitates the semi-automatic annotation of question segments included in the questionnaire with standardized terms from a broad set of metadata schemas and ontologies. It furthermore allows users to define, reuse and make available to other users their own controlled term sets for questionnaire annotation.
AgroFIMS+ also incorporates text analysis features that allows the definition of text-level similarities between question and learn from user feedback.

The tool is fully compliant with the XLSForm specification and thus allows the exporting of questionnaires in formats that can be used with any compliant application like the Open Data Kit (ODK) suite. Additionally, its integration with FAIRscribe allows the easy upload of your “born FAIR” data to Dataverse and/or CKAN repository platforms.
